# Algorithmic Problem-Solving Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of over 200 solutions to algorithmic challenges from competitive programming platforms such as **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, **Codewars**, **Project Euler**, and **Advent of Code**.  The primary goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my proficiency in Python, my approach to problem-solving, and my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.
